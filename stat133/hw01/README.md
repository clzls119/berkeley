This homework is about using different built-in functions to graph and get values of the imported data(about cars' make, mpg, price, horsepower, and so on).
In this assignment, we use mean, median function to get average prices and other numeric features and use graphs (bar, histogram, stars...) to find any correlation between certain features of cars. 
We also use variety of ways to extract and manipulate dataframe as we want to output.
